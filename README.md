# The Node

## Introduction
The Node is a 10 week data science program hosted at [HackCville](hackcville.com) in Charlottesville, VA.

The goal of the program is for you to learn the foundations of data science in Python and practice applying these skills to different types of projects.

We will use this Github repo to hold our week by week curriculum. This repo is open to the public, so _anyone_ can learn data science just by following along in the repo.

## Topics we will cover
* Intro to Python and Pandas
* Intermediate Pandas and Basic Statistics
* Visualization
* Regression
* Classification
* Text Analysis
* Neural Networks, Decision Trees and Random Forests
